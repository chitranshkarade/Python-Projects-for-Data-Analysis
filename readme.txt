## Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets. The scripts and notebooks in this repository provide a foundation for understanding and visualizing data, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights.

### Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate EDA techniques on different datasets. Each notebook focuses on a specific dataset and provides step-by-step instructions and explanations.

- **Scripts**: This directory contains Python scripts that perform EDA tasks on various datasets. The scripts are modular and can be used as standalone files or incorporated into other projects.

- **Data**: This directory contains sample datasets used in the notebooks and scripts. It provides a starting point for practicing EDA techniques.

- **Documentation**: This directory contains additional documentation, tutorials, or guides related to EDA concepts and best practices.
